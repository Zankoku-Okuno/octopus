TODO

General
	better pretty-print
		show as octopus parses, not as haskell does
		apply judicious indentation
		the angle brackets are ambiguous, use #<...>
	first-class patterns?
	serialize values, even mutable cells and the current program state
	consider putting types into the grammar, unchecked of course

Parser
	allow names like /([^0-9-]|-[^0-9])\.*|-/
	atom ::= ... | ':(' /<name>:/ <expr>+ ')' | /@<name>/ | @(' /<name>:/ <expr>+ ')' | /\.<expr>/ | '.(' <expr>+ ')'
		@ is prefix, : and . are infix
	distfixes
	special syntax for lambda and vau (use the primitive ones, allow for stuff like (\l (x y z) body))
	block comments
	heredocs
	decorators in do blocks?
	ellipsis?
	assertion syntax?
	export form in file
		currently, it exports the whole environment
		a way to give out a limited set would be very useful
	import form objects
		{x, y, z: foo} === {x: x, y: y, z: foo}
	literals for closures, primitives, tags, &c (using #<...> syntax)?

Interpreter
	Data primitives
		eq
		fileps
		tags
		reference cells
		arrays
		handlers?
		conversions
	Import primitive:
		read/parse/eval file, returns result of evaluation (which of course is the env at the end of the file)
		don't forget to memoize these so import is idempotent
		also, some imports might not be from a file, or may be relative to the install environ
	First-class control
	objects are self-evaluating, except those that have not yet been eval'd
	abstract types
		a primitive to construct a triple of (tag, constructor, deconstructor)
		we'll need a typeof operator, which returns a tag.
		might be nice to give names to types
	Floating point primitive type
	REPL
	re-raise exceptions

Documentation
	geting started
	definition
	Octopus for (JS, OOlang, Lisp, ...) Programmers
	every primitive type and operation: what they do and when/how they fail

Cleanup
	put Shortcuts in Octopus.Data
	eliminate magic field names

Tooling
	Virtual envitonment
	Packaging
		may as well design it general:
		the package metadata should describe the target language
		that way, I can use the same protocols for Octopus, Murex and Nautilus
	lint/runtime warnings:
		detect no parenthesis on a multi-expression do line (statement or expression)
		possible misspellings (rough analysis of do blocks, especially note similar spellings)
		unsafe filenames (target the lowest common denominator)
		malformed type names (these should have a standard form, like /\w+(\.\s+)*/)
		warn about rebinding double-underscore symbols
	When you run the interpreter, allow for hooks.
		Say you do `octopus "somefile.oct", then we should look up from configuration a list of commands to run when a file is provided. The is given to these commands and each command is run. If all the commands succeed, then we send the file (which many have been modified, say by unicoder) into the interpreter.

Performance
	Applicative closures
	Extended data primitves
	try using `Rose (Map Symbol (Maybe Val))` for objects to reduce space consumption
		The maybe val is there so that a lookup can return (Just Nothing), which is equivalent to (Nothing)
